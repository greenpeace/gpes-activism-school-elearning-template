```

**[Download](https://github.com/greenpeace/gpes-activism-school-elearning-template/archive/master.zip)**

### 2 - Edit this lesson 

This is an html5 lesson, so if you know some html and css editing should be easy to do. It uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) the worldâ€™s most popular libraries.

## Create an elearning SCORM package

### 1 - Link and configure

Once you have finished your lesson, uncomment this html line at the end of index.html:

```html
<script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gp-misc/e-learning/scormfunctions.js"></script>
```

You should also customise this variables:

```html
<script>
    var pageScore = 1;
    var minCompletedTime = 30;
</script>
```

- The `pageScore` is added when the user leaves the page and should be between 0 and 100.
- The `minCompletedTime` is the minimum ammount of time (in seconds) for the presentation to be considered complete.

If you create more than one html files, you should do this step in all your html files.

### 2 - Edit the table of contents

You can have multiple html pages in the same SCROM package. This example has only one, `index.html` 

To add or remove them to the table of contents you need to modify [imsmanifest.xml](imsmanifest.xml) with a text editor like [Brackets](http://brackets.io/). **Look at the examples** in the sections `<organizations>` `<item>` and `<resources>` of this xml. And edit it carefully!

### 3 - Package and upload

Create the SCORM package (a zip file):

```bash
cd this-repository-folder
zip -r mylesson.zip *
```

Upload `mylesson.zip` to [Moodle, as a SCORM package](https://docs.moodle.org/36/en/SCORM_settings). (It should work with any **L**earning **M**anagement **S**ystem that supports SCORM).
